This tool allows users to extract every file in specific arc files. These files can then be loaded as mods and even modified.

To be clear, this tool doesn't actually just extract clothing files but any files that can be found within edit mode. Hair, faces, clothes, whatever. It'll pull those files out and any related to them.
